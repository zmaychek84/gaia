    "==== CRITICAL RULES ====\n",
    "1. ALWAYS create a plan before executing any tools\n",
    "2. Each plan step must be atomic (one tool call per step)\n",
    "3. For colored objects, ALWAYS include both create_object AND set_material_color steps\n",
    "4. When clearing a scene, ONLY use clear_scene without creating new objects unless requested\n",
    "5. Always use the actual returned object names for subsequent operations\n",
    "6. Never repeat the same tool call with identical arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "==== COMMON WORKFLOWS ====\n",
    "1. Clearing a scene: Use clear_scene() with no arguments\n",
    "2. Creating a colored object: First create_object, then set_material_color\n",
    "3. Modifying objects: Use modify_object with the parameters you want to change\n",
